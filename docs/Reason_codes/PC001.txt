Table 8.a   Reason codes associated with step "PREPRO", 
            program code 001 (last revised 5/30/2001). 

NOTE 1: 
FOR ALL DATA TYPES EXCEPT TOVS AND GOES RETRIEVALS, THE ENCODED 
QUALITY MARKER FOR SPECIFIC HUMIDITY (QQM) IS SET 
TO THE ENCODED QUALITY MARKER FOR TEMPERATURE (TQM).
THEREFORE, ANY EVENTS ON TQM FOR THESE DATA TYPES ARE ALSO EVENTS ON QQM. 
THE EVENTS ON QQM LISTED HERE ARE SEPARATE FROM THOSE ON TQM. 

NOTE 2: 
FOR ALL DATA TYPES, THE ENCODED QUALITY MARKER FOR WIND U- AND 
V-COMPONENTS (WQM) IS ALSO THE ENCODED QUALITY MARKER 
FOR WIND SPEED AND DIRECTION (DFQ) AND FOR WIND
SPEED (SQM). IN ADDITION, ALL ENCODED EVENTS FOR THE UOB,
VOB,WQM SEQUENCE ALSO APPLY TO THE DDO,FFO,DFQ SEQUENCE. 
  

KEY: 
IN "R.CODE" COLUMN: 
               B - OCCURS IN ALL OPERATIONAL VERSIONS OF PREPRO. 
               N - CURRENTLY DOES NOT OCCUR IN ANY OPERATIONAL VERSION OF PREPRO. 

IN "MNEMONIC" COLUMN: 
               ## - QUALITY MARKER IS USUALLY DEFINED AS THE WORSE OF THE TWO 
                    SPANNING LEVEL QUALITY MARKERS FOR THE DATA USED TO CREATE 
                    THE OBSERVATION (OF THE SAME DATA TYPE).

======================================================================================================

Most PREPRO "events" are not yet assigned a reason code, so it is missing. In this case the 
observation and/or quality marker may or may not be the original value. (This will change 
in the future as events and their reason codes are added to the PREPRO step.)
