======   ==============================================  ==============================================

01 B     WIND OBSERVATION ON A SINGLE LEVEL FAILED Q.C.  WRC-> WQM=13 
         CHECKS (AND REASON CODE 04 AND 05 BELOW DO NOT 
         APPLY).

02 B     WIND OBSERVATIONS ON ADJACENT LEVELS FAILED     WRC-> WQM=13 
         Q.C. CHECKS  (AND REASON CODES 04 AND 05 BELOW 
         DO NOT APPLY).

03 B     COMBINATION OF REASON CODES 01 AND 02 ABOVE.    WRC-> WQM=13

04 B     WIND OBSERVATION HAS SPEED LESS THAN 1          WRC-> WQM=13 
         METER/SECOND.

05 B     WIND OBSERVATION IS AFFECTED BY BIRD MIGRATION  WRC-> WQM=13
