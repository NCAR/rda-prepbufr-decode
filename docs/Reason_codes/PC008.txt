00 B     SPECIFIC HUMIDITY OBSERVATION IS REGENERATED    QRC-> QOB=# 
         FROM REPORTED DEWPOINT TEMPERATURE AND 
         PRESSURE. (DEWPOINT TEMPERATURE HAS UNDERGONE 
         POSSIBLE CQC AND RADIATION CORRECTIONS). THIS 
         IS VALID ONLY FOR SURFACE LAND OR MARINE DATA 
         TYPES.
 
00 B     TEMPERATURE OBSERVATION IS CONVERTED TO VIRTUAL TRC-> TOB=# 
         TEMPERATURE, CALCULATED FROM THE REGENERATED 
         SPECIFIC HUMIDITY (SEE ABOVE) AND FROM A 
         TEMPERATURE OBSERVATION THAT HAS UNDERGONE 
         POSSIBLE COMPLEX QUALITY CONTROL AND RADIATION
         CORRECTIONS. THIS IS VALID ONLY FOR SURFACE 
         LAND OR MARINE DATA TYPES.

01 B     SPECIFIC HUMIDITY OBSERVATION IS REGENERATED    QRC-> QOB=#  
         FROM REPORTED DEWPOINT TEMPERATURE AND 
         PRESSURE. (DEWPOINT TEMPERATURE HAS UNDERGONE
         POSSIBLE CQC AND RADIATION CORRECTIONS). THIS 
         IS VALID ONLY FOR RADIOSONDE, DROPWINSONDE, 
         AND MULTI-LEVEL RECONNAISSANCE DATA TYPES.

01 B     TEMPERATURE OBSERVATION IS CONVERTED TO         TRC-> TOB=# 
         VIRTUAL TEMPERATURE, CALCULATED FROM THE 
         REGENERATED SPECIFIC HUMIDITY (SEE ABOVE) AND
         FROM A SENSIBLE TEMPERATURE OBSERVATION THAT 
         HAS UNDERGONE POSSIBLE COMPLEX QUALITY 
         CONTROL AND RADIATION CORRECTIONS. THIS IS 
         VALID ONLY FOR RADIOSONDE, DROPWINSONDE, AND 
         MULTI-LEVEL RECONNAISSANCE DATA TYPES.

02 B     TEMPERATURE OBSERVATION IS CONVERTED TO         TRC-> TOB=#, TQM=8 
         VIRTUAL TEMPERATURE, CALCULATED FROM THE 
         REGENERATED SPECIFIC HUMIDITY (SEE ABOVE)
         AND FROM A SENSIBLE TEMPERATURE OBSERVATION 
         THAT HAS UNDERGONE POSSIBLE COMPLEX QUALITY 
         CONTROL AND RADIATION CORRECTIONS. THE SPECIFIC
         HUMIDITY HAS A REJECTED QUALITY MARKER. VIRTUAL 
         TEMPERATURE IS CONSIDERED BAD. THIS IS VALID
         ONLY FOR SURFACE LAND OR MARINE DATA TYPES.

07 B     TEMPERATURE OBSERVATION IS CONVERTED TO VIRTUAL TRC-> TOB=#, TQM=3 
         TEMPERATURE, CALCULATED FROM THE REGENERATED 
         SPECIFIC HUMIDITY (SEE ABOVE) AND FROM A
         SENSIBLE TEMPERATURE OBSERVATION THAT HAS 
         UNDERGONE POSSIBLE COMPLEX QUALITY CONTROL AND
         RADIATION CORRECTIONS.  THE SPECIFIC HUMIDITY 
         HAS A REJECTED QUALITY MARKER. THE PRESSURE 
         LEVEL IS BELOW 700 MB AND THE SENSIBLE
         TEMPERATURE QUALITY MARKER IS EITHER 1, 2 OR 3.  
         VIRTUAL TEMPERATURE IS CONSIDERED SUSPECT.  
         THIS IS VALID ONLY FOR RADIOSONDE, DROPWINSONDE, 
         AND MULTI-LEVEL RECONNAISSANCE DATA TYPES.
